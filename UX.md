## Screen Elements

| Element | Type | Position | Visible when | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Status bar gradient** | Fixed overlay | Top, full width | Always | Dark-to-transparent gradient so system clock/battery icons stay readable over the map tiles |
| **MapContainer** | Full-screen canvas | Background | Always | Leaflet map, zoom 19–20, no built-in zoom or attribution controls |
| **Tile layers** ×7 | Map layer | Behind all UI | `currentLayer` matches | OpenStreetMap, OpenTopoMap, CartoDB, OSM Humanitarian, Stadia Satellite, Esri World Imagery, CyclOSM — only the active one is opaque; all others `opacity: 0` |
| **User location marker** | Map marker | GPS coordinates | GPS active | Pulsing ultrared.png human figure with animated ring (`user-loc-pulse`) |
| **Sound blob markers** | Map markers | Each recording's GPS coords | Always (valid coords + duration > 0) | Duration circles that scale with recording length and current zoom level. Color: blue <30s, green 30–60s, red >60s. Tap opens Popup |
| **Marker Popup** | Map popup | Floats above tapped blob | On tap | Shows recording filename, duration, timestamp, species tags, notes. Triggers `handleMarkerClick` |
| **Live breadcrumb trail** | Map overlay | GPS path currently walked | `currentBreadcrumbs.length > 0` | `BreadcrumbVisualization` — modes: `animated` (default, draws progressively), `line` (instant colored line), `heatmap` (audio-intensity circles), `markers` (dot per crumb) |
| **Past derive tracklines** | Map overlay | Each completed session's GPS path | Session in `visibleSessionIds` + ≥2 breadcrumbs | `BreadcrumbVisualization` in `line` mode with `lineColor='auto'` — each segment colored by movement state and audio level (green=moving, red=high audio, gray=stationary) |

## Fixed UI — Top Area

| Element | Type | Position | Visible when | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Back button** | Icon button | Top-bar left | Always | Returns to landing screen |
| **GPS recenter** | Icon button | Top-bar | Always | Flies map back to user location at auto-computed zoom |
| **Breadcrumb toggle** | Cycle button | Bottom control bar | Always | Cycles through visualization modes: Línea → Calor → Anim. Active mode shown with colored background |
| **Layer selector** | Dropdown button | Top-bar | Always | Opens tile-layer picker dropdown (glass panel). Active layer highlighted in green |

| **Record FAB** | Round button 52px | `bottom: 130px`, `left: calc(50% - 80px)` | AudioRecorder not open | Semi-transparent red mic button (`rgba(194,74,110,0.82)`, blur). Starts derive if none active; opens AudioRecorder modal |
| **Play FAB** | Round button 52px | `bottom: 130px`, `left: calc(50% + 28px)` | Player panel collapsed | Semi-transparent green play button (`rgba(157,192,76,0.82)`, blur). Opens the expanded player panel |
| **Derive stats pill** | Tap target | `bottom: 138px`, centered | Active derive session | Shows elapsed time, distance walked, recording count, "Fin" button. Tap opens End Derive confirmation. Dims when paused |

## Modals and Panels

| Element | Type | Position | Visible when | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Expanded player panel** | Draggable floating card | `bottom: 120px`, centered | `playerExpanded = true` | Glass-morphism (`rgba(220,225,235,0.78)`). Draggable by handle. Contains: title + recording count; 9 playback mode chips; active track timeline(s) with `TracklistItem` progress bars + playhead dot; ▶ Play / ■ Stop / 🔇 Mute; volume slider; proximity-volume toggle |
| **Info / Capas / Import-Export modal** | Centered modal | Screen center | ⓘ button pressed | Glass panel (`rgba(220,225,235,0.78)`, `blur(16px)`). Tabs/sections: Capas de Derivas (session visibility toggles + per-session export), Import/Export (ZIP import, export all recordings), playback mode info, bioacoustic metadata guide |
| **End Derive confirmation** | Floating card | `bottom: 120px`, centered | Derive pill tapped | Glass panel. Shows session stats (time, distance, recordings). Buttons: Pause/Resume, Finalizar (name + save), Cancelar |

## Playback Modes

### Bioacústica

| Mode | Icon | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Cercanos** | 📍 | Spots within 100m — spatial stereo pan by GPS bearing, volume by distance |

| **Alba** | 🌅 | Recordings captured during dawn hours at their recording coordinates |
| **Crepúsculo** | 🌇 | Recordings captured during dusk hours at their recording coordinates |
| **Estratos** | 🌿 | Sorted by estimated frequency (duration used as proxy), playing ecoacoustic strata in sequence |

### Arte Sonoro

| Mode | Icon | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Cronológico** | 📅 | Sequential playback in recording timestamp order |
| **Jamm** | 🎛️ | All visible tracks simultaneously, each with independent stereo L↔R panning animation |
